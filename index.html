    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        CRU is an acronym that stands for "Campus Crusade for Christ". What does
        that mean? We're a group of students at IIT who are passionate about
        sharing the gospel of grace with those we come in contact with. We come
        from all different denominations of christian churches, but we all have
        one thing in common (besides the fact that we go to Illinois Tech). We
        love Jesus-and not in your removed Sunday-school kind of way. We want to
        grow in our relationships with him through prayer and studying the Bible,
        and we'd love for you to join us on this journey!

        Our mission is ______. This means that _____.
      </p>
    <h2>Where to find us</h2>
      <h3>Weekly Meetings</h3>
        <p>
          We meet every Thursday night at 7pm in the Godbox (aka Carr Chapel).
          These weekly meetings typically last an hour to an hour and a half, and
          we spend this time in fellowship with one another. A meeting begins
          with worship, moves to an icebreaker activity, proceeds to a mini-sermon
          from a guest speaker, and ends with worship. Weekly meetings are a great
          way to meet other believers on campus and make new friends! All are
          welcome!
        </p>
      <h3>Bible Studies</h3>
        <p>
          We hold various Bible studies throughout the week to allow students to
          learn more about what the Bible really says. This semester we are going
          through the book of Romans, and our study times are as follows:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Monday- 7pm -MTCC Colored Rooms</li>
            <li>Tuesday- campus lunch hour -PH 108</li>
            <li>Tuesday- 5pm -Gunsaulus 306 (athletes only)</li>
            <li>Wednesday- campus lunch hour -WH 116 (women only)</li>
            <li>Wednesday- 7pm -MTCC Colored Rooms</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          Each of these groups studies the same passage every week, so we encourauge
          you to find one that fits with your schedule. (If none of these times
          work with your schedule, please let us know at _______ or consider
          trying discipleship).
        </p>
      <h3>Discipleship</h3>
        <p>
          Discipleship is a one-on-one weekly meeting with a CRU staff member or
          older student. These meetings serve as bible studies, spiritual
          conversations, and accountability sessions. Unlike a bible study, this
          individual meeting allows you to choose what topic you would like to go
          through with your discipler for the semester, so you can always be
          focused on what's been put on your heart. Discipleship allows you to
          really walk beside another person and share your spiritual journey with
          them.

    <h2>We'll leave you with this</h2>
      <p>
        We always close our weekly meetings with the great commission, and we'd
        like to end this time with you in the same way. In Matthew 28:19-20, Jesus
        says, "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in
        the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching
        them to obey all that I have commanded you. And surely I am with you
        always, even to the end of the age". Go in peace dear reader, you are
        loved.
