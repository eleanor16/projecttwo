        <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <p>
          CRU is an acronym that stands for "Campus Crusade for Christ". What
          does that mean? We're a group of students at IIT who are passionate
          about sharing the gospel of grace with those we come in contact with.
          We come from all different denominations of christian churches, but we
          all have one thing in common (besides the fact that we go to Illinois
          Tech). We love Jesus-and not in your removed Sunday-school kind of
          way. We want to grow in our relationships with him through prayer and
          studying the Bible, and we'd love for you to join us on this journey!
        </p>
        <p class="endingp">
          Our mission is love God and love others. This means that we want to
          get to know you better and go through life with you.

          <h3>Weekly Meetings</h3>
            <p>
              We meet every Thursday night at 7pm in the Godbox (aka Carr
              Chapel). These weekly meetings typically last an hour to an hour
              and a half, and we spend this time in fellowship with one another.
              A meeting begins with worship, moves to an icebreaker activity,
              proceeds to a mini-sermon from a guest speaker, and ends with
              worship. Weekly meetings are a great way to meet other believers
              on campus and make new friends! All are welcome!

            <h3>Bible Studies</h3>
              <p>
                We hold various Bible studies throughout the week to allow
                students to learn more about what the Bible really says. This
                semester we are going through the book of Romans, and our study
                times are as follows:
              </p>
              <ul id="dates">
                <li>Monday- 7pm -MTCC Colored Rooms</li>
                <li>Tuesday- campus lunch hour -PH 108</li>
                <li>Tuesday- 5pm -Gunsaulus 306 (athletes only)</li>
                <li>Wednesday- campus lunch hour -WH 116 (women only)</li>
                <li>Wednesday- 7pm -MTCC Colored Rooms</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Each of these groups studies the same passage every week, so we
                encourauge you to find one that fits with your schedule. (If
                none of these times work with your schedule, please let us know
                at <a href="mailto:iitcru@gmail.com">iitcru@gmail.com</a> or
                consider trying discipleship).

        <h3>Discipleship</h3>
          <p>
            Discipleship is a one-on-one weekly meeting with a CRU staff member
            or older student. These meetings serve as bible studies, spiritual
            conversations, and accountability sessions. Unlike a bible study,
            this individual meeting allows you to choose what topic you would
            like to go through with your discipler for the semester, so you can
            always be focused on what's been put on your heart. Discipleship
            allows you to really walk beside another person and share your
            spiritual journey with them.

          <h3>Boat Cruise</h3>
            <p>
              Every fall, we gather all of the CRU student groups in Chicago for
              a fun night of dancing on the Chicago river. This event is a great
              way to make new friends outside of our campus while taking a break
              from all that studying that IIT requires. The cruise typically
              happens on a Saturday near the end of September and lasts from
              6-9pm. We meet at global grounds on campus and take the train to
              Trump tower where we join other groups and board the boat!

          <h3>Fall Retreat</h3>
            <p>
              Every October, we take a weekend to get away from the stress of
              school and hang out in nature through our fall retreat. Once
              again, this event is held with students from other Chicago
              universities, so it's a great way to meet up with those friends
              you made at boat cruise! Throughout this time, students play
              games, participate in worship, hear small sermons, and take
              personal quiet time to listen to what the Lord has to say to them.
              If you'd like more information about this event, please visit <a

          <h3>Big Break</h3>
            <p>
              Wondering what to do with your spring break? Consider taking your
              faith journey a step further and join us for Big Break! Big Break
              is a trip we take during our spring break to  bring the gospel to
              others outside of our campus community. We go down  to Pensacola
              beach and spend our afternoons starting spiritual conversations
              with anyone who happens to be there. This is a wonderful
              opportunity to  share what you believe in-you never know the
              impact you might have on someone  else's life. If you're
              interested in going to Big Break, please contact us at <a

          <h2>We'll leave you with this</h2>
            <p>
              We always close our weekly meetings with the great commission, and
              we'd like to end this time with you in the same way. In Matthew
              28:19-20, Jesus says, "Go therefore and make disciples of all
              nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son
              and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey all that I have
              commanded you. And surely I am with you always, even to the end of
              the age". Go in peace dear reader, you are loved.
