      <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <p>
          CRU is an acronym that stands for "Campus Crusade for Christ". What
          does that mean? We're a group of students at IIT who are passionate
          about sharing the gospel of grace with those we come in contact with.
          We come from all different denominations of christian churches, but we
          all have one thing in common (besides the fact that we go to Illinois
          Tech). We love Jesus-and not in your removed Sunday-school kind of
          way. We want to grow in our relationships with him through prayer and
          studying the Bible, and we'd love for you to join us on this journey!
        </p>
        <p class="endingp">
          Our mission is love God and love others. This means that we want to
          get to know you better and go through life with you.
