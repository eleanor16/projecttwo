            <p>
              Every fall, we gather all of the CRU student groups in Chicago for
              a fun night of dancing on the Chicago river. This event is a great
              way to make new friends outside of our campus while taking a break
              from all that studying that IIT requires. The cruise typically
              happens on a Saturday near the end of September and lasts from
              6-9pm. We meet at global grounds on campus and take the train to
              Trump tower where we join other groups and board the boat!

            <p>
              Every October, we take a weekend to get away from the stress of
              school and hang out in nature through our fall retreat. Once
              again, this event is held with students from other Chicago
              universities, so it's a great way to meet up with those friends
              you made at boat cruise! Throughout this time, students play
              games, participate in worship, hear small sermons, and take
              personal quiet time to listen to what the Lord has to say to them.
              If you'd like more information about this event, please visit <a

              Wondering what to do with your spring break? Consider taking your
              faith journey a step further and join us for Big Break! Big Break
              is a trip we take during our spring break to  bring the gospel to
              others outside of our campus community. We go down  to Pensacola
              beach and spend our afternoons starting spiritual conversations
              with anyone who happens to be there. This is a wonderful
              opportunity to  share what you believe in-you never know the
              impact you might have on someone  else's life. If you're
              interested in going to Big Break, please contact us at <a
              href="mailto:iitcru@gmail.com">iitcru@gmail.com</a>.

              we still take some time to relax and have fun! Here are some of
              our students playing spike ball, a game that's become popular on
              our campus.</figcaption>
